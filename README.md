# LEGO Spike Prime Learning Programs (SPIKE 3)

Fun, bite-sized Python programs for learning robotics with LEGO Spike Prime!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

These programs teach you how to:

- Control motors and create movement
- Read sensors (color, distance, force)
- Show images and text on the hub
- React to button presses and motion
- Build a line-following robot
- Run multiple tasks simultaneously

## 📚 Lesson Overview

### Beginner Lessons (5-10 minutes each)

1. **01_hello_motor_spike3.py** - Make a motor spin
2. **02_color_sensor_spike3.py** - Detect colors
3. **03_distance_bot_spike3.py** - Stop before hitting walls
4. **04_force_sensor_spike3.py** - Control motor with force sensor
5. **05_motor_pair_spike3.py** - Drive a robot with two motors
6. **06_hub_display_spike3.py** - Show images and text
7. **07_button_control_spike3.py** - React to button presses

### Intermediate Lessons (10-15 minutes each)

1. **08_line_follower_spike3.py** - Build a line-following robot
2. **09_motion_sensor_spike3.py** - Detect tilt, shake, and orientation

### Advanced Lesson (10+ minutes)

1. **10_advanced_async_spike3.py** - Run multiple tasks at once

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

Each program lists what you need at the top:

- LEGO Spike Prime Hub (required for all)
- Motors (various ports)
- Sensors (Color, Distance, Force)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read [HOW_TO_RUN.md](HOW_TO_RUN.md) for setup instructions
2. Start with Lesson 1
3. Build the required hardware
4. Copy code into LEGO Spike Prime App
5. Run and experiment!

## 💡 Learning Tips

✅ **Read the comments** - They explain each step
✅ **Change the numbers** - See what happens!
✅ **Build first** - Make sure hardware is ready
✅ **Experiment** - Try your own ideas

## 🆕 SPIKE 3 Features

These programs use the **SPIKE 3 Python API** which includes:

- `runloop` module for async programming
- Separate modules for each component (`motor`, `color_sensor`, etc.)
- Improved performance and reliability
- Better multi-tasking support
